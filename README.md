# MultiDimensional
-> Please see square matrix.cpp
-> You're doing a great job :) I think let's complete the theater one and we are good with multi dimensional arrays. Like then we'll learn as more comes up but for the time being we are good to go 
-> I hope you understood the dynamics of the upperhalf.cpp like how it works. This type of array manipulation is usually done in data structures and you're doing great comparatively. I want you to alter the code a bit so it displays for the lower half and maybe like you could do it for all the four possible combinations of the diagonals. And umm I hope you have the basic concept so don't use internet this time 

1            1    1 2 3     1 2 3
2 3        2 3    4 5         4 5
4 5 6    4 5 6    6             6

I hope you get the gist of what I am saying !
This kind of stuff is really interesting like coming up with the logic part, enjoy doing it :D !
