// Notes: I am doing this question from the textbook questions you sent me. So far I have decided on what functions 
// I will create and use. I am getting an error on line 40 (Thread 1: SIGNAL SIGBRT) and it does run successfully
// But it stops at that function and doesn't proceed to the next function which is ticketSales. 
// Why is this? Am i using the functions wrong?
