//  You'll use a single array, and ummm you'll use type casting and ummm if the word is Apple, you can convert it to Alpha with getting the first character of Apple which is 'A' and subtracting it by 65. As the ascii code of A is 65. That way you get 0. And on the zero. Index of your array you would have Alpha. If it would have been Batman, then B minus 65 gives you 1 as B is 66. So on the index number 1 you have Bravo. And there you have your solution. I hope it helped
